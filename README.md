# Node.js Learning Repository

Welcome to my Node.js learning repository! This directory is where I document and store the projects and exercises I complete as I learn Node.js.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to build a solid understanding of the core concepts of Node.js, including:
- Modules
- File system interaction
- HTTP server basics
- Asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await)
- Event-driven architecture

## Folder Structure

- **/projects**: This folder contains the Node.js projects I work on to apply concepts I've learned.
- **/resources**: A collection of notes, tutorials, and helpful links to learn from.
- **/scripts**: Small code snippets or experiments related to specific Node.js features.

## How to Use

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd nodejs-learning
Feel free to explore the various projects and resources I've documented here as I build my foundation in Node.js.
